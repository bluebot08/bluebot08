Hi, I'm Stefan! 👋🏼 I'm a full-stack programmer living in Japan. 

After taking a year-long break to help raise my child 👶🏼, I'm excited to be back and ready to dive into my passions for movies 🎥, music 🎵, games 🎮, and technology 💻. I'm particularly interested in creating websites that enhance people's enjoyment of these areas.

If you want to reach me, the best way is to email me at oneil.stefan@gmail.com I'm looking forward to connecting with you! 😊

Here is some snazzy data!
