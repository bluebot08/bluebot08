Hello, I'm Stefan! 👋🏼 I'm a full-stack programmer living in near Tokyo.

After taking a year-long break to help raise my child 👶🏼, I'm starting to study machine learning by dipping into python. 
If you want to get in contact with me, the best way is to email me at oneil.stefan@gmail.com I'm looking forward to connecting with you! 😊

Here is some snazzy data!
