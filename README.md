Hi, I'm Stefan! 👋🏼

After taking a year-long break to raise my child 👶🏼, I'm excited to be back and ready to dive into my passions for movies 🎥, music 🎵, games 🎮, and technology 💻. I'm particularly interested in creating websites that enhance people's enjoyment of these areas.

Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in full-stack development and I'm open to collaborating on any projects that align with my interests and skills.

If you want to reach me, the best way is to email me at oneil.stefan@gmail.com I'm looking forward to connecting with you! 😊
